# Tistatsi

**TIny STATic SIte generator** - A simple GUI tool for building HTML sites without code.

## Features

### Themes
Tistatsi supports custom themes for your websites using specially formatted CSS files. A GUI-based theme creator is planned for future releases.

- **Included Theme**: `simple_modern` - based on CSS from [my photography portfolio](https://squidud.github.io/Photography-Portfolio/)
- **Custom Themes**: Load your own CSS themes through the theme selector

### Section Layout
Build your site using horizontal sections that contain 1-3 elements each:

- **Titles** - Header text elements
- **Paragraphs** - Body text content  
- **Images** - Automatically compressed and optimized for web

*Planned additions: iframe embeds, videos, and buttons*

Tistatsi automatically compresses and optimizes uploaded photos for fast loading times. Upload high-resolution images and they'll be processed automatically.
